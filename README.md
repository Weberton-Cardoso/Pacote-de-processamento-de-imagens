# package_name

Description. 
The package package_name is used to:
	The Python Package Index, abbreviated as PyPI (/ˌpaɪpiˈaɪ/) and also known as the Cheese Shop (a reference to the Monty Python's Flying Circus sketch "Cheese Shop"),[2][3] is the official third-party software repository for Python.[4] It is analogous to the CPAN repository for Perl[5] and to the CRAN repository for R. PyPI is run by the Python Software Foundation, a charity. Some package managers, including pip, use PyPI as the default source for packages and their dependencies.[6][7]

As of 17 January 2022, more than 350,000 Python packages can be accessed through PyPI.[8]

PyPI primarily hosts Python packages in the form of archives called sdists (source distributions) or precompiled "wheels."[9]

PyPI as an index allows users to search for packages by keywords or by filters against their metadata, such as free software license or compatibility with POSIX.[10] A single entry on PyPI is able to store, aside from just a package and its metadata, previous releases of the package, precompiled wheels (e.g. containing DLLs on Windows), as well as different forms for different operating systems and Python versions.
